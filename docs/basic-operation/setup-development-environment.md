# Set up the development environment

## Set chain environment variables

We will configure and use cliffnet-1 as the development and testing environment.

cliffnet-1 is a chain for developing and testing cosmwasm contracts, its token unit is `PEBBLE`, and the unit is `upebble`. 1 `PEBBLE` = 1000000 `upebble`.

Blockchain browser URLï¼š https://block-explorer.cliffnet.cosmwasm.com

We utilize curl to acquire the environment configuration variables of the cliffnet-1 testnet and configure them to the current equipment. The wasmd commands will apply the environment variables.

```
source <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/cliffnet-1/defaults.env)
```

The content of `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/cliffnet-1/defaults.env` is as follows
```
export CHAIN_ID="cliffnet-1"
...
export FEE_DENOM="upebble"\
...
export RPC="https://rpc.cliffnet.cosmwasm.com:443"
export FAUCET="https://faucet.cliffnet.cosmwasm.com"
...
export NODE=(--node $RPC)
export TXFLAG=($NODE --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --gas-prices 0.025upebble --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3)
```

As you can see, it includes some environment variables.

## Set up wallet

Create two wallets, called wallet, wallet2 separately.

```
wasmd keys add wallet
wasmd keys add wallet2
```

The output is as follows

```
- name: wallet
  type: local
  address: wasm1lkmecvu06lr8hpak7j4uh2jllvdt78ee4d3sh6
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A0bry1pEw2qsQWwhN08LZFUFebyzDLYEFTv0EWNvm8QR"}'
  mnemonic: ""

## Acquire some tokens from the testnet

Next, we use wallet to request some tokens from the testnet.

```
JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet) '{"denom":"upebble","address":$addr}') && curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.cliffnet.cosmwasm.com/credit
```

In the above command:
1. Apply `wasmd keys show -a wallet` to get the wallet address.
2. Apply the `jq` command to set the wallet address as the `addr` variable to `{"denom":"upebble","address":$addr}`. The result is as follows: `{"denom":"upebble","address":"wasm1evvnsrte3rdghy506vu4c87x0s5wx0hpppqdd6"}`, assign it to the `JSON` variable.
3. Applying `JSON` as the request parameter, use curl to send a POST request to https://faucet.cliffnet.cosmwasm.com/credit.

Similarly, use the wallet2 to request some tokens from the testnet.

```
JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet2) '{"denom":"upebble","address":$addr}') && curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.cliffnet.cosmwasm.com/credit
```

## Check wallet balance

```
ADDR=$(wasmd keys show -a wallet) && wasmd query bank balances $ADDR $NODE
```

Output:

```
balances:
- amount: "100000000"
  denom: upebble
pagination: {}
```

You can also query the balance through the blockchain browser.
